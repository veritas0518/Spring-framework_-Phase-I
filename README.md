# Spring-framework_-Phase-I
Nothing special has happened recently. Instead, I wrote an argue letter to Sheffield University, and they replied to me soon. They mainly said that the ranking of those schools was not high enough. They were speechless. I don't know why a university valued the ranking so much, but didn't care about the level of the students themselves. Anyway, it doesn't matter, Before Christmas Eve and Christmas, I wrote two more argue letters to them until they blackmailed me, and then wrote another letter in the last round. It's like this. I can't help it. I can only do my best. I'm going back to school on Tuesday. I feel that time passes really fast. Now the stage of java learning is finally to integrate SSM, but there are still a lot of things to learn. I don't know if I can remember what I have learned. This feeling is the most uncomfortable. But what's worse is that there are still algorithm problems to brush. I really hate algorithm problems, but you won't be able to learn real things. Learning is really a long process. Now I haven't even learned springboot, but fortunately there is still some time to learn, but I don't know if I can get a responsive salary after learning, which is the most important thing. Now I feel in a very embarrassing situation and have to catch up with the progress. Don't say much. May God bless me!
